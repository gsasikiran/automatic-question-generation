context:  the name rijn , from here on , is used only for smaller streams farther to the north , which together formed the main river rhine in roman times . though they retained the name , these streams no longer carry water from the rhine , but are used for draining the surrounding land and polders . from wijk bij duurstede , the old north branch of the rhine is called kromme rijn ( " bent rhine " ) past utrecht , first leidse rijn ( " rhine of leiden " ) and then , oude rijn ( " old rhine " ) . the latter flows west into a sluice at katwijk , where its waters can be discharged into the north sea . this branch once formed the line along which the limes germanicus were built . during periods of lower sea levels within the various ice ages , the rhine took a left turn , creating the channel river , the course of which now lies below the english channel .
question:  during what ages were the limes germanicus built ?
predicted:  what is the the strasbourg of the rhine ?

context:  the strong force only acts directly upon elementary particles . however , a residual of the force is observed between hadrons ( the best known example being the force that acts between nucleons in atomic nuclei ) as the nuclear force . here the strong force acts indirectly , transmitted as gluons , which form part of the virtual pi and rho mesons , which classically transmit the nuclear force ( see this topic for more ) . the failure of many searches for free quarks has shown that the elementary particles affected are not directly observable . this phenomenon is called color confinement .
question:  the successful searches for what showed that the elementary particles are not observable ?
predicted:  what is the term for the ?

context:  if a problem x is in c and hard for c , then x is said to be complete for c. this means that x is the hardest problem in c. ( since many problems could be equally hard , one might say that x is one of the hardest problems in c. ) thus the class of np - complete problems contains the most difficult problems in np , in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in p. because the problem p = np is not solved , being able to reduce a known np - complete problem , π2 , to another problem , π1 , would indicate that there is no known polynomial - time solution for π1 . this is because a polynomial - time solution to π1 would yield a polynomial - time solution to π2 . similarly , because all np problems can be reduced to the set , finding an np - complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that p = np .
question:  the hardest problems in np can be analogously written as what class of problems ?
predicted:  what is the difficulty of a - time ?

context:  decision problems are one of the central objects of study in computational complexity theory . a decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either yes or no , or alternately either 1 or 0 . a decision problem can be viewed as a formal language , where the members of the language are instances whose output is yes , and the non - members are those instances whose output is no . the objective is to decide , with the aid of an algorithm , whether a given input string is a member of the formal language under consideration . if the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer yes , the algorithm is said to accept the input string , otherwise it is said to reject the input .
question:  what answer denotes that a solution has accepted an input string ?
predicted:  what is the be considered to determine the ?

context:  since september 2004 , the official home of the scottish parliament has been a new scottish parliament building , in the holyrood area of edinburgh . the scottish parliament building was designed by spanish architect enric miralles in partnership with local edinburgh architecture firm rmjm which was led by design principal tony kettle . some of the principal features of the complex include leaf - shaped buildings , a grass - roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings . throughout the building there are many repeated motifs , such as shapes based on raeburn 's skating minister . crow - stepped gables and the upturned boat skylights of the garden lobby , complete the unique architecture . queen elizabeth ii opened the new building on 9 october 2004 .

predicted:  what direction of the east of the east of the dutch east ?

context:  free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world 's water bodies . the increased solubility of o 2 at lower temperatures ( see physical properties ) has important implications for ocean life , as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content . water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce amounts of o 2 in eutrophic water bodies . scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water 's biochemical oxygen demand , or the amount of o 2 needed to restore it to a normal concentration .
question:  what do phosphates do to the growth of nitrates ?
predicted:  what is the to thermal gas includes water water ?

context:  legrande writes that " the formulation of a single all - encompassing definition of the term is extremely difficult , if not impossible . in reviewing the voluminous literature on the subject , the student of civil disobedience rapidly finds himself surrounded by a maze of semantical problems and grammatical niceties . like alice in wonderland , he often finds that specific terminology has no more ( or no less ) meaning than the individual orator intends it to have . " he encourages a distinction between lawful protest demonstration , nonviolent civil disobedience , and violent civil disobedience .

context:  the connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with statistical mechanics . in macroscopic closed systems , nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of the system , and are often associated with the transfer of heat . according to the second law of thermodynamics , nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as entropy increases .
question:  in macroscopic open systems , non conservative forces act to do what ?
predicted:  what does the contamination system of ?

context:  during the 1970s and sometimes later , western and pro - western governments often supported sometimes fledgling islamists and islamist groups that later came to be seen as dangerous enemies . islamists were considered by western governments bulwarks against — what were thought to be at the time — more dangerous leftist / communist / nationalist insurgents / opposition , which islamists were correctly seen as opposing . the us spent billions of dollars to aid the mujahideen muslim afghanistan enemies of the soviet union , and non - afghan veterans of the war returned home with their prestige , " experience , ideology , and weapons " , and had considerable impact .

predicted:  what magazine described the bronx as a potential of of spent ?

context:  the tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla ( " little tentacles " ) , although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches . the tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it . colloblasts are specialized mushroom - shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis , and have three main components : a domed head with vesicles ( chambers ) that contain adhesive ; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea ; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk . the function of the spiral thread is uncertain , but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape , and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart . in addition to colloblasts , members of the genus haeckelia , which feed mainly on jellyfish , incorporate their victims ' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria - eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense . the tentilla of euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids : they contain striated muscle , a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum ctenophora ; and they are coiled when relaxed , while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed . euplokamis ' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey : they may flick out very quickly ( in 40 to 60 milliseconds ) ; they can wriggle , which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms ; and they coil round prey . the unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle . the wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles , but of a highly specialized type . coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state , but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle .
question:  what do the vesticles on tentilla contain ?
predicted:  what are the animals separated into ?

context:  the path of violence and military struggle was then taken up by the egyptian islamic jihad organization responsible for the assassination of anwar sadat in 1981 . unlike earlier anti - colonial movements the extremist group directed its attacks against what it believed were " apostate " leaders of muslim states , leaders who held secular leanings or who had introduced or promoted western / foreign ideas and practices into islamic societies . its views were outlined in a pamphlet written by muhammad abd al - salaam farag , in which he states :

context:  gamma delta t cells ( γδ t cells ) possess an alternative t cell receptor ( tcr ) as opposed to cd4 + and cd8 + ( αβ ) t cells and share the characteristics of helper t cells , cytotoxic t cells and nk cells . the conditions that produce responses from γδ t cells are not fully understood . like other ' unconventional ' t cell subsets bearing invariant tcrs , such as cd1d - restricted natural killer t cells , γδ t cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity . on one hand , γδ t cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange tcr genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype . on the other hand , the various subsets are also part of the innate immune system , as restricted tcr or nk receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors . for example , large numbers of human vγ9 / vδ2 t cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes , and highly restricted vδ1 + t cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells .
question:  what is fully understood about γδ t cells ?
predicted:  what does the ability to transform the

context:  civil disobedients have chosen a variety of different illegal acts . bedau writes , " there is a whole class of acts , undertaken in the name of civil disobedience , which , even if they were widely practiced , would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance ( e.g. trespassing at a nuclear - missile installation) ... such acts are often just a harassment and , at least to the bystander , somewhat inane ... the remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity . " bedau also notes , though , that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose . some civil disobedients , such as the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries and voice in the wilderness , which brought medicine to iraq without the permission of the u.s. government , directly achieve a desired social goal ( such as the provision of medication to the sick ) while openly breaking the law . julia butterfly hill lived in luna , a 180-foot ( 55 m)-tall , 600-year - old california redwood tree for 738 days , successfully preventing it from being cut down .

context:  since its foundation , the treaties sought to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement . reflecting the economic nature of the project , the european community originally focused upon free movement of workers : as a " factor of production " . however , from the 1970s , this focus shifted towards developing a more " social " europe . free movement was increasingly based on " citizenship " , so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active , rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights . this means the basic " worker " rights in tfeu article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in tfeu articles 18 to 21 . according to the court of justice , a " worker " is anybody who is economically active , which includes everyone in an employment relationship , " under the direction of another person " for " remuneration " . a job , however , need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker . for example , in steymann v staatssecretaris van justitie , a german man claimed the right to residence in the netherlands , while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the bhagwan community , which provided for everyone 's material needs irrespective of their contributions . the court of justice held that mr steymann was entitled to stay , so long as there was at least an " indirect quid pro quo " for the work he did . having " worker " status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments , and employers , in access to employment , tax , and social security rights . by contrast a citizen , who is " any person having the nationality of a member state " ( tfeu article 20(1 ) ) , has rights to seek work , vote in local and european elections , but more restricted rights to claim social security . in practice , free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people 's jobs and benefits ( paradoxically at the same time ) . nevertheless , practically " all available research finds little impact " of " labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers " .

context:  there is evidence that there have been significant changes in amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21,000 years through the last glacial maximum ( lgm ) and subsequent deglaciation . analyses of sediment deposits from amazon basin paleolakes and from the amazon fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the lgm was lower than for the present , and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin . there is debate , however , over how extensive this reduction was . some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small , isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland ; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north , south , and east than is seen today . this debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the amazon basin , and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data .

context:  in connectionless mode each packet includes complete addressing information . the packets are routed individually , sometimes resulting in different paths and out - of - order delivery . each packet is labeled with a destination address , source address , and port numbers . it may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet . this precludes the need for a dedicated path to help the packet find its way to its destination , but means that much more information is needed in the packet header , which is therefore larger , and this information needs to be looked up in power - hungry content - addressable memory . each packet is dispatched and may go via different routes ; potentially , the system has to do as much work for every packet as the connection - oriented system has to do in connection set - up , but with less information as to the application 's requirements . at the destination , the original message / data is reassembled in the correct order , based on the packet sequence number . thus a virtual connection , also known as a virtual circuit or byte stream is provided to the end - user by a transport layer protocol , although intermediate network nodes only provides a connectionless network layer service .

context:  the needs of soy farmers have been used to justify many of the controversial transportation projects that are currently developing in the amazon . the first two highways successfully opened up the rainforest and led to increased settlement and deforestation . the mean annual deforestation rate from 2000 to 2005 ( 22,392 km2 or 8,646 sq mi per year ) was 18 % higher than in the previous five years ( 19,018 km2 or 7,343 sq mi per year ) . although deforestation has declined significantly in the brazilian amazon between 2004 and 2014 , there has been an increase to the present day .

context:  a controversial aspect of imperialism is the defense and justification of empire - building based on seemingly rational grounds . j. a. hobson identifies this justification on general grounds as : " it is desirable that the earth should be peopled , governed , and developed , as far as possible , by the races which can do this work best , i.e. by the races of highest ' social efficiency ' " . many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons . friedrich ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive , imperialism was needed . halford mackinder felt that great britain needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism . the purportedly scientific nature of " social darwinism " and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism . the rhetoric of colonizers being racially superior appears to have achieved its purpose , for example throughout latin america " whiteness " is still prized today and various forms of blanqueamiento ( whitening ) are common .

context:  immunology is strongly experimental in everyday practice but is also characterized by an ongoing theoretical attitude . many theories have been suggested in immunology from the end of the nineteenth century up to the present time . the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between " cellular " and " humoral " theories of immunity . according to the cellular theory of immunity , represented in particular by elie metchnikoff , it was cells – more precisely , phagocytes – that were responsible for immune responses . in contrast , the humoral theory of immunity , held , among others , by robert koch and emil von behring , stated that the active immune agents were soluble components ( molecules ) found in the organism ’s “ humors ” rather than its cells .
question:  what were the two main theories of immunity at the end of the 19th century ?
predicted:  cellular immunology theorized the same origin of cells ?

context:  several project structures can assist the owner in this integration , including design - build , partnering and construction management . in general , each of these project structures allows the owner to integrate the services of architects , interior designers , engineers and constructors throughout design and construction . in response , many companies are growing beyond traditional offerings of design or construction services alone and are placing more emphasis on establishing relationships with other necessary participants through the design - build process .

context:  connection - oriented transmission requires a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication . the packets include a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints so that they are delivered in order and with error checking . address information is only transferred to each node during the connection set - up phase , when the route to the destination is discovered and an entry is added to the switching table in each network node through which the connection passes . the signaling protocols used allow the application to specify its requirements and discover link parameters . acceptable values for service parameters may be negotiated . routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection i d in a table . the packet header can be small , as it only needs to contain this code and any information , such as length , timestamp , or sequence number , which is different for different packets .
question:  what is a connection identifier

context:  during the mass high school education movement from 1910–1940 , there was an increase in skilled workers , which led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor . high school education during the period was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work . in fact , it differs from the present high school education , which is regarded as a stepping - stone to acquire college and advanced degrees . this decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers . education is very important for the growth of the economy , however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy . lagerlof and galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth , and continued gender inequality in education , thus creating a poverty trap . it is suggested that a large gap in male and female education may indicate backwardness and so may be associated with lower economic growth , which can explain why there is economic inequality between countries .

context:  while acknowledging the central role economic growth can potentially play in human development , poverty reduction and the achievement of the millennium development goals , it is becoming widely understood amongst the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth . the effect of economic growth on poverty reduction – the growth elasticity of poverty – can depend on the existing level of inequality . for instance , with low inequality a country with a growth rate of 2 % per head and 40 % of its population living in poverty , can halve poverty in ten years , but a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction . in the words of the secretary general of the united nations ban ki - moon : " while economic growth is necessary , it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty . "

context:  in regard to companies , the court of justice held in r ( daily mail and general trust plc ) v hm treasury that member states could restrict a company moving its seat of business , without infringing tfeu article 49 . this meant the daily mail newspaper 's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the uk . the uk did not need to justify its action , as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised . by contrast , in centros ltd v erhversus - og selkabssyrelsen the court of justice found that a uk limited company operating in denmark could not be required to comply with denmark 's minimum share capital rules . uk law only required £ 1 of capital to start a company , while denmark 's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 danish krone ( around € 27,000 ) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent . the court of justice held that denmark 's minimum capital law infringed centros ltd 's freedom of establishment and could not be justified , because a company in the uk could admittedly provide services in denmark without being established there , and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection . this approach was criticised as potentially opening the eu to unjustified regulatory competition , and a race to the bottom in standards , like in the us where the state delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards , and low corporate taxes as a result . similarly in überseering bv v nordic construction gmbh the court of justice held that a german court could not deny a dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in germany . although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection , labour rights to participate in work , or the public interest in collecting taxes , denial of capacity went too far : it was an " outright negation " of the right of establishment . however , in cartesio oktató és szolgáltató bt the court of justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law , they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose . this meant that the hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to italy while it still operated and was incorporated in hungary . thus , the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies ( where restrictions must be justified ) , and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory , although it is not entirely clear why .

context:  the simplest valve gears give events of fixed length during the engine cycle and often make the engine rotate in only one direction . most however have a reversing mechanism which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually " shortening the cutoff " or rather , shortening the admission event ; this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period . however , as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows , a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant ; if the exhaust event is too brief , the totality of the exhaust steam can not evacuate the cylinder , choking it and giving excessive compression ( " kick back").[citation needed ]
question:  of what length are engine cycle events when the simplest valve gears are used ?
predicted:  what is the maximum of a freight elevator ?

context:  since its founding , the eu has operated among an increasing plurality of national and globalising legal systems . this has meant both the european court of justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems . within the eu itself , the court of justice 's view is that if eu law conflicts with a provision of national law , then eu law has primacy . in the first major case in 1964 , costa v enel , a milanese lawyer , and former shareholder of an energy company , named mr costa refused to pay his electricity bill to enel , as a protest against the nationalisation of the italian energy corporations . he claimed the italian nationalisation law conflicted with the treaty of rome , and requested a reference be made to both the italian constitutional court and the court of justice under tfeu article 267 . the italian constitutional court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962 , and the treaty was in force from 1958 , costa had no claim . by contrast , the court of justice held that ultimately the treaty of rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation , and in any case under the treaty provisions only the commission could have brought a claim , not mr costa . however , in principle , mr costa was entitled to plead that the treaty conflicted with national law , and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision . the court of justice , repeating its view in van gend en loos , said member states " albeit within limited spheres , have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves " on the " basis of reciprocity " . eu law would not " be overridden by domestic legal provisions , however framed ... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question . " this meant any " subsequent unilateral act " of the member state inapplicable . similarly , in amministrazione delle finanze v simmenthal spa , a company , simmenthal spa , claimed that a public health inspection fee under an italian law of 1970 for importing beef from france to italy was contrary to two regulations from 1964 and 1968 . in " accordance with the principle of the precedence of community law , " said the court of justice , the " directly applicable measures of the institutions " ( such as the regulations in the case ) " render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law " . this was necessary to prevent a " corresponding denial " of treaty " obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states " , that could " imperil the very foundations of the " eu . but despite the views of the court of justice , the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis .
